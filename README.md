## Overview
CLI-Project

## Working-
Open any IDE and run the program, it will run in the terminal.
I have tested it in Eclipse and Vscode.
Run the -> Chess.java file (it contains the main method). The program will get executed and you can see the output in the terminal only.


I have attached several screenshots of the output within the folder.
